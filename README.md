# ACS

`ACS` is a browser-first game platform inspired by `Adventure Construction Set`.

The initial focus is a retro, tile-based, single-player construction set with a playable browser runtime. The architecture is intentionally split so later phases can support richer graphics, audio, AI, and simulation models without rewriting the core content model.

## Milestone 0

- TypeScript monorepo with workspace boundaries
- shared package layout for domain and schema code
- architecture decision records
- versioning and naming conventions

## Milestone 1

- shared domain types
- versioned adventure package schema
- parser and validation entry points
- schema migration stubs

## Workspace Layout

```text
apps/
  api/
  web/
docs/
  adr/
packages/
  content-schema/
  domain/
```

## Core Rules

- Runtime core must remain renderer-agnostic.
- Published releases must be immutable.
- Draft content and published releases are separate concepts.
- Content packages and saves are versioned from the start.
- Assets are referenced by IDs, not hardcoded file paths in gameplay logic.
- Structured triggers/actions are preferred over arbitrary user code.
